The system uses NGINX as the directionagent server and the volume server, which on server side we deploythe application server to integrate a variety of application service,and at the front end browser we implement the aggregation and displayof static web pages, front-end script and server side service.\nStudents can access the lab\u0026rsquo;s website system through the campusnetwork. After logging in via the account and password, they canenter the work table, which is responsible for the personal test workand the push of various messages. The system is not in accordancewith the traditions about the conventional module, professional basicexperiment module and comprehensive improvement type and researchinnovation type lab module to set the module and interface, but basedon the user\u0026rsquo;s actual workflow to layout. In the background, we apply“extended finite state machine”(national invention patent201510323287.6) for flow control. The main functions include: testadvanced controlled (preview, examination, appointment anddiscussions, submit), automatic grouping and intra group discussionbased on the timely communication, and community based creative aggregation and recruitment, appointment and distribution,recruitment and selection, interactive discussion, and etc. The teachers can also log on to the work table with the account andpassword, which is responsible for personal test work and the push ofvarious messages. The main work of teachers is to complete the initialization of professional test set (test preparation content,theory test, questionnaire and opening period, the grouping principle, etc.), group evaluation, curriculum information uploadingto share, discussing guidance in homework marking, making an appointment to distribution, recruitment and selection, node report,and results publishing, etc.\n  A caption   --  ","date":1600176349,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600176349,"objectID":"9b74b6d80c74c11210b876d3c28bd186","permalink":"/project/project1/","publishdate":"2020-09-15T21:25:49+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/project1/","section":"project","summary":"the Automation Laboratory Network Platform. “The automation lab network platform fusing web 2.0 technology and facingcultivation of innovation and practice ability","tags":[],"title":"the Automation Laboratory Network Platform","type":"project"},{"authors":["Jian Fu"],"categories":[],"content":"武汉理工大学工业自动化综合实验室的设计 工业自动化综合实验室根据自动化学院教学任务需要而设计，以自动化课程为重点，涵盖了包括信息、电子、计算机、工业机器人在内的多个专业核心技术，满足教师和学生在教学、科研和实践中的需要。\n","date":1600176349,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600176349,"objectID":"219e0ced15bf8d3e94fbc95e3ac27a86","permalink":"/zh/project/project3/","publishdate":"2020-09-15T21:25:49+08:00","relpermalink":"/zh/project/project3/","section":"zh","summary":"武汉理工大学工业自动化综合实验室的设计 工业自动化综合实验室根","tags":[],"title":"武汉理工大学工业自动化综合实验室的设计","type":"zh"}]
